    "You've been hired as the manager of Sacred Heart Medical Clinic (SHMC). As part of its business model, SHMC usually employs doctors on demand, meaning that doctors are asked to come only when there are appointments. However, once a doctor has been asked to come, you must pay him or her regardless of whether the patient shows up or not. You want to use data on previous appointments to figure out whether you can predict which patients are going to show up, so that you can plan better how many doctors to call."
